Changes — The history of the Tree-Range releases  -*- Changes -*-

0.22  2013-08-06

      – Reverted back to the explicit ‘$VERSION’ assignment (were: using
        a two-argument ‘package’ form.)

0.21  2013-08-05

      – New ‘Tree::Range::conflict’ and ‘Tree::Range::RB::Conflict’
        classes.

      – New ‘range_free_p’, ‘range_set_over’, ‘range_iter_closure’,
        ‘min_node’, and ‘max_node’ range tree methods.

      – Removed all the mentions of the ‘base’ package (or pragma.)

      – The key comparison function is now called only once per the
        underlying tree node being deleted while associating a range
        with a value (was: called up to two times.)

      – Minor fixes and improvements to the documentation.
